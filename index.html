              Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript
              to make a webpage more dynamic.HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland. He came up with the idea of an Internet-based hypertext system.Hypertext means a text that contains references 
              (links) to other texts that viewers can access immediately. He published the first version of HTML in 1991, consisting of 18 HTML tags. Since then, each new version of the HTML language came with new tags and attributes (tag modifiers) to 
              the markup.According to Mozilla Developer Network’s HTML Element Reference, currently, there are 140 HTML tags, although some of them are already obsolete (not supported by modern browsers).Due to a quick rise in popularity, HTML is now 
              considered an official web standard. The HTML specifications are maintained and developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). You can check out the latest state of the language anytime on W3C’s website.The biggest upgrade of the language 
              was the introduction of HTML5 in 2014.Besides, HTML is delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Below, there are some examples of HTML
              frequently used tags :<br>
              <ul>
               <li><b>The <a class ="HTMLtags">(HTML)</a> tag is the highest level element that encloses every HTML page. </b></li>
               <br>
               <li><b>The <a class="HTMLtags">(Head)</a> tag holds meta information such as the page’s title.</b></li>
               <br>
               <li><b>The <a class="HTMLtags">(Body)</a> tag encloses all the content that appears on the page.</b></li>
               <br>
               <li><b>The <a class="HTMLtags">(p)</a> tag defines a paragraph in HTML.</b></li>
               <br>
               <li><b>The <a class="HTMLtags">(img)</a> tag defines an image in HTML.</b></li>
              </ul>

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation 
                characteristics,and enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to 
                improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as 
                on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.The name cascading comes from the 
                specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
